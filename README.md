# MasterChef

  MasterChef is a farming pool that distributes profits fairly based on the quantity and duration of tokens staked by each user. It allows for the creation of multiple specific LP Token staking pools, with each pool being assigned a corresponding weight as needed. Users need to provide liquidity for a specific trading pair in a decentralized exchange (Swap) to receive the corresponding LP Token. They can then stake the LP Token in a specific pool to continuously earn proportional rewards. Users have the flexibility to participate and exit at any time, with earnings being settled in real-time.
